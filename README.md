## Office Hour notes:
- Use of Sequential Feature Selector (SFS) : This is one way to show the importance of specific independent features against a dependent feature
- Need to review the advantages of using MAE (mean absolute error) vs RMSE (root mean squared error) with regards to the dangers fo inflating the error values when predicting an outcome in a model.
- review different types of cross validation starting with k-fold cross validation.
